/* Note, that initial anonymous mmap() can be avoided - after initial mmap()
for
descriptor fd, you can try mmap() with hinted address as (buffer->address +
buffer->count_bytes) and if it fails - another one with hinted address as
(buffer->address - buffer->count_bytes). Make sure MAP_FIXED is not used in
such
case, as under certain situations it could end with segfault. The advantage of
such approach is, that it avoids requirement to map twice the amount you need
initially (especially useful e.g. if you want to use hugetlbfs and the allowed
amount is limited) and in context of gcc/glibc - you can avoid certain feature
macros (MAP_ANONYMOUS usually requires one of: _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE or
_GNU_SOURCE). */

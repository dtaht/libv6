* Verilog

To keep myself honest I think that sometimes I should write the VHDL along
with the ERM C. If you think my C was rusty, my last bit of verilog was in 2006,
and the last serious time was in 1992. I do hope all the tools have got as much
better as C has!

In particular the risc-v is of interest because of the custom synthesis ability
in it and I have FPGAs that can run it. A risc-v + a few helpful functional
units - would be quite nice.

I haven't touched a HDL in nearly a decade, either. And they were all so damn
slow back in the old days - and written in java.

Expect much, much, flailing here in the coming months.

Looks DAMN attractive... from a distance.

* why not verilog?

After surveying the landscape since I last thought about this, it appears
the world has moved to VHDL. Risc-v is vhdl, in particular. I just found
tools for [[http://tce.cs.tut.fi/documentation.html][Transport triggered]]
architectures that also generated VHDL. That was the trigger to say, well,
let's look hard at VHDL.

* Why not systemC?

No good reason. it does look to have got MUCH better since last time I tried it.

* Why not opencores

have to look it over.

* Why not [some proprietary cpu]?

don't want to hitch myself to the uBlaze wagon, or any other wagon that I don't
have total control over. Besides erm should run halfway decently on arm and x86
in the first place, and there are some new xeon + fpga things coming out worth
trying.

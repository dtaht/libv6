* Benchmarks
There really is no long term point to doing this unless it can actually run
faster than the native linux kernel for a multitude of operations.

Unfortunately, getting there requires a lot of coding up front.

** Microbenchmarks
*** DONE Vectored Blanusa solver
*** Additive metric solver
*** TODO Hash with popcount speed
** TODO Macrobenchmarks
*** Cpu overhead
*** Route table import
*** Route table export
*** Route table change
*** IP Comparisons/second
*** Packets/sec (forwarding)

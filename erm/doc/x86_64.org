Sadly:

The LOCK prefix can be prepended only to the following in structions and only to
those forms of the instructions where the destination operand is a memory
operand: ADD, ADC, AND, BTC, BTR, BTS, CMPXCHG, CMPXCH8B, CMPXCHG16B, DEC, INC,
NEG, NOT, OR, SBB, SUB, XOR, XADD, and XCHG

The manual says you can do this on the x86
LOCK AND reg1 reg2

LOCK CMPXCHG m8,r8 5 ~51

unsigned __int64 _xgetbv( unsigned int);

FS and GS segment registers?

CR2 contains the virtual address that triggered the page fault

CR3 controls

CR8

The AMD64 architecture allows software to define up to 15 external interrupt-priority classes.

So, if you're going to use C, do what the rest of the C world does, which is set up a flat-memory model, use paging, and ignore the fact that segmentation even exists.


http://wiki.osdev.org/Segment_Limits#Segmentation

For instance, Microsoft Windows on x86-64 uses the GS segment to point to the Thread Environment Block, a small data structure for each thread, which contains information about exception handling, thread-local variables, and other per-thread state. Similarly, the Linux kernel uses the GS segment to store per-CPU data.

long __builtin_expect(long EXP, long C);
This construct tells the compiler that the expression EXP
most likely will have the value C. The return value is EXP.
__builtin_expect is meant to be used in an conditional
expression. In almost all cases will it be used in the
context of boolean expressions in which case it is m

* ERM CPU instruction set

One of the weirdest things about ERM is that there is no instruction set.

This doc is a bit unclear on that, there is 

* Big endian vs little endian

Is pretty naturally big endian, rather than little endian.

It's possible - with some enforcement of stronger typing - to make it be little
endian, if you enforced an underlying word length of the number of tag bits.

You'd have a string type for example - 

char *a;
char *b;

And these might map down to the same physical memory space, but offset by one.

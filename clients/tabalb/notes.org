* There are 10 global variables
* Everything is optimized for vector processing
** aligned to natural boundaries
** always in tables large enough for a prefetch overrun
* Everything is a table - with frequently accessed types in their own table indexed separately
** all classification is on the way in
** No pointers
* C bitfields are used where appropriate, masks elsewhere
** Very small values everywhere - think hardware or 16 bit microcontroller
* Code sharing is maximized
* C11 features like structure return are used extensively
** Often structures are returned instead of using the stack
In the case of NEON and SSE we can slam the structures into existing registers.
In the case of hardware certain things end up in registers anyway.
Yes, structures are a PITA in regular C, and hard on the compiler.
* Internationalization will be enabled
** But string sharing across modules is hard
* Direct calls to library functions are wrapped
** Because at some point I'm going to violate the ABI
